    "A few things to note about loop plotting:  First, loops are topological objects, and what is plotted is neccesarily a particular geometric representation of the loop (based on using the Voronoi diagram dual to the Delaunay triangulation as control points).  This representation is topologically equivalent to the initializing geometric curves (can be deformed into one-another without going through the trajectory points - i.e. isotopic).  Second, geometric curves that are 'open' will have their ends wrap around the nearest point so that their loop is closed.  Third, what is being plotted is actually a train-track (segments of a loop that go though a given triangle are bundled together into one segment, which splits and merges with other segments; all while being tangent at splitting point).  As the loop becomes more convoluted, the train-track provides a way to visualize the aspects of the topological loop data.  What is lost in this representation is how many pieces of the loop have been bundled together (i.e. the weights/intersection coordinates).  In a moment we will see a few way to encode this information in the plot."

The default setting for the color_map is 'inferno_r', which you can change if you have a favorite (try to use only perceptually uniform sequential color maps).  The default for how we assign a weight a color is given by log_color = True (the linear color scale is mapped onto the log of the weights, highlighting the full spectrum of weights).  For the next plot, let's set log_color = False, and let's turn off the background triangulation, which is getting crowded, and set the boundary back to normal:"

    "With the colors being linear in the weights, the plot highlights the very largest weights most.  Next, let's see how to encode the weight data in the width of the train-track segments.  We do this with the DelaunayAdd = True plot parameter.  We will also turn the color weights off.  The DelaunayAdd option plots the train-track segments with a line width that scales linearly with weight (max line width is set with linewidth_tt).  The individual segments then perceptually add as they merge at junctions.  A minimum linewidth (under which all lines are plotted with this width) is set using tt_lw_min_frac (default = 0.05 means a maximum linewidth of 10 gives a minimum linewidth of 0.5)."
