* covert many of the comments into doc strings

*automatically generate teh docs

* include the most recent additions to plotting to the regular triangulation2D class (currently updated in PBC version)

* put in the copy method for both versions

* create a new overall class - TopologicalAdvection - which takes in the same full trajectory infomation, periodic BC flag/ FDsize, time data.  It can then initialize the triangluation object (and copy), it can have methods to fully evolve the triangulation forward, evolve and make a movie, simple options for loop initialization, and loop evolution, finding the topological entropy, and later, perhaps finding any coherent structures.

* Use GitHub for version control (ongoing)



* flesh out the examples
