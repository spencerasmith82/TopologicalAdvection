# TopologicalAdvection
Represent curves on a 2D surface up to topological equivalence and evolve (advect) these curves forward in time due to the movement of points in a flow.

For details on the modules, classes, methods, etc. that make up the topological advection algorithm, see the [Coding Documentation](https://spencerasmith82.github.io/TopologicalAdvection/).  A good starting place for most use cases is the top-level class topological_advection.py.

For examples, take a look at the example python notebooks in [examples](https://github.com/spencerasmith82/TopologicalAdvection/tree/main/examples).

A paper to cite will be coming shortly.  For now, use: Spencer A. Smith, **Topological Advection**, 2025. as a placeholder.
